			<h2>So, what exactly is this Dragon Code thing anyway? Is it like a code of ethics?</h2>
			<blockquote>A knight is sworn to valor. His heart knows only virtue. His blade defends the helpless. His might upholds the weak. His word speaks only truth. His wroth undoes the wicked.</blockquote>
			<p>Wait a minute. Scratch that. Forget I quoted that. That's the Old Code, a code of honor from the Dragonheart movie trilogy. You should totally watch those movies if you haven't, or even if you have 'cause they're that good. The Dragon Code is completely unreleated.</p>

			<p>I'll do it later. Right now I'm procrastinating by trying to decide which font looks best with this site's color scheme. Also I'm fiddling with the color scheme. And I'm drawing the images for the navigation buttons.</p>
			<p>Until I get around to putting some DragonCode documentation here, I suggest you explore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030216031515/http://www.dragoncode.org/">this</a> Wayback Machine copy of dragoncode.org</p>
