			<h2>So, what exactly is this Dragon Code thing anyway? Is it like a code of ethics?</h2>
			<blockquote>A knight is sworn to valor. His heart knows only virtue. His blade defends the helpless. His might upholds the weak. His word speaks only truth. His wroth undoes the wicked.</blockquote>
			<p>Wait a minute. Scratch that. Forget I quoted that. That's the Old Code, a code of honor from the Dragonheart movie trilogy. You should totally watch those movies if you haven't, or even if you have 'cause they're that good. The Dragon Code is completely unrelated.</p>

			<h2>Ha ha, very funny. Now tell me about the real Dragon Code.</h2>
			<p>Until I get around to finishing this section of dragonsmoke.cloud, I suggest you explore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030216031515/http://www.dragoncode.org/">this</a> Wayback Machine copy of dragoncode.org. That's where I'm getting everything I know; I'm simply putting some effort into rewriting it in my own words to avoid any plagiarism or copyright infringement.</p>

				<h4>Introduction and Miscellaneous Doubleplusimportant Details</h4>
				<p>Tags are listed in this document in alphabetical order, except for the "DC2." tag which identifies the version of the Dragon Code in use, and the Species tag. I don't think order is important when reading/writing Dragon Codes except that the version identifier must come first and must be immediately followed by the Species tag if the Species tag is present.</p>
				
				<p>Every tag is optional except for the version identifier. Readers have to know what code this is, after all.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="DragonCodeVersion" class="DragonCodeArticle">
				<h4>Dragon Code Version Identifier</h4>
				<p>The first 2 letters, DC, indicate that this is the Dragon Code. They are followed by a number - 2 in this case, since this is the second version - and then a period (.)</p>
				<p>The version identifier is mandatory.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="DragonCodeSpeciesTag" class="DragonCodeArticle">
				<h4>The Species Tag</h4>
				<p>The Species tag, if present, must immediately follow the "DC2.". Thus the tag itself does not need to be identified with any letters, unlike other tags.</p>
				<p>As with all tags, Species is not mandatory. If you don't include it, however, then you must put a space (<a href="https://codepoints.net/U+0020" target="_blank">U+0020 SPACE</a>) after the "DC2." to separate it from other tags.</p>
				<p>It is worth noting that, although this is called the <em>Dragon</em> Code, there are a number of other species included too. If your species is not listed, you can write it out in "double quotes" (either two of <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+0022" target="_blank">U+0022 QUOTATION MARK</a> or one each of <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+201C" target="_blank">U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</a> and <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+201D" target="_blank">U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</a>). If your species fits into a general group, put the group first followed by the species in "double quotes". For example, if you had a draconic species called "Mckdle" (those are just some random letters I typed; don't try to pronounce it!), then your Species tag would look like <pre>D"Mckdle"</pre></p>

						Wiktionary defines the word amphibian as
						<blockquote cite="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=amphibian&oldid=41969943">
							<ol>
								<li>An animal of the Amphibia; any four-legged vertebrate that does not have amniotic eggs, living both on land and in water.</li>
								<li>A vehicle which can operate on land and water. See Wikipedia article on "Amphibious aircraft"</li>

						While one certainly could consider certain species as vehicles (horse riding is a thing, after all), for the purpose of the Dragon Code we tend to use the first definition.
