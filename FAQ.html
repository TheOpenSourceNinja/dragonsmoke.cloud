		<p>This FAQ is mostly about questions I've encountered or asked on the newsgroup. I may add other questions too. For questions more focused on draconity in general, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.tomorrowlands.org/draconity/faq/index.html" target="_blank">Baxil's draconity FAQ</a>.</p>

			<h2>Some links on this site don't work. Where can I find X?</h2>
			<p>AFD has been around a long time. Resources, both official and unofficial, may disappear. Contrary to what some people seem to believe, merely posting something on the Internet does not automatically make it everlasting and invulnerable. <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank">The Wayback Machine</a> is an attempt to make such longevity a reality: they archive any web page their spiders encounter. Copy the non-working link URL from this site and paste it into their search bar. Boom, there you go.</p>
			<p>An alternative to this is the Google cache. You can see the latest version of a page that Google has cached by using their <code>cache:</code> search operator. Copy the non-working link URL, then go to <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> and type into their search bar <code>cache:</code> followed by pasting the URL, e.g. "<code>cache:https://www.dragonsmoke.cloud</code>" would give you the cache of this site's main page.</p>

			<h2>What's the best newsreader for connecting to the newsgroup?</h2>
			<p>Beats me. Most email programs will work; I use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a> because it also sends &amp; receives email, reads RSS feeds, and does instant messaging. If you want something specifically for Usenet, try <a href="http://pan.rebelbase.com/" target="_blank">Pan</a> or <a href="http://xpn.altervista.org/index-en.html" target="_blank">XPN</a>.</p>

			<h2>What's the best Usenet server for connecting to the newsgroup?</h2>
			<p>All I know for sure is that the one I use, Eternal September, works. I have also subscribed to AFD in Google Groups as a backup. <a href="free NNTP servers.txt">Here</a>'s a list of free servers.</p>

			<h2>What age range is this stuff appropriate for?</h2>
			<p>On the newsgroup, we try to keep things appropriate for all ages: not aimed at little kids, but also not the kind of stuff parents would object to.</p>
			<p>I get the feeling that the Alfandria MUCK is aimed more towards adults.</p>

			<h2>Should I respond to spam or objectionable content?</h2>
			<p>On the newsgroup, we call spammers trolls. They hunger for attention. Don't feed the trolls. As the newsgroup is unmoderated, starving the trolls of attention is the only way to drive them away.</p>

			<h2>What are some different names of AFD?</h2>
			<p>alt.fan.dragons, AFD, Alfandra, Alfandria (generally applies to the MUCK), Here (spelled with a capital H to differentiate it from one's physical location), This Place (same), the Wang Toodle</p>

			<h2>What's all this about the Magic of This Place?</h2>
			<p>It is said that by invoking the name of one who has not been seen recently, you are calling upon the Magic to draw them back. The Magic can also be that force which attracts new people to join.</p>

			<h2>What's that gibberish some people put in their signatures? You know, the block of text starting with "DC2.".</h2>
			<p>That's the Dragon Code, a space-saving way of describing dragons and other species.</p>
