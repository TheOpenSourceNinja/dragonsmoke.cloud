		<h1>Under Construction</h1>
		<p>Yark! You've found your way to a site that's still under construction!</p>
		<p>The content of the site is more-or-less in place (mostly less), but the site's visual design still needs a lot of work.</p>
		<p>Welcome, weary traveler. Here you can rest your wings and imbibe a mug of hot klah. This site is dedicated to dragons and dragon-friends. I guess you can consider it the official web site of the newsgroup Alt.Fan.Dragons, seeing as this site is maintained by somebody who regularly posts there. Maybe not as official as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150213215849/http://www.dragonfire.org/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Dragonfire</a> was, since Dragonfire was made by the actual founder of AFD, but that site doesn't appear to exist anymore.</p>
