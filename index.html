		<h1>Under Construction</h1>
		<p>Yark! You've found your way to a site that's still under construction!</p>
		<p>The content of the site is more-or-less in place (mostly less), but the site's visual design still needs a lot of work.</p>
		<p>Welcome, weary traveler. Here you can rest your wings and imbibe a mug of hot klah. This site is dedicated to dragons and dragon-friends. I guess you can consider it the official web site of the newsgroup Alt.Fan.Dragons, seeing as this site is maintained by somebody who regularly posts there. Maybe not as official as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150213215849/http://www.dragonfire.org/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Dragonfire</a> was, since Dragonfire was made by the actual founder of AFD, but that site doesn't appear to exist anymore.</p>

			<p>As webmaster, I make these promises to you:</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Accessibility</summary>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This site is proud to use 100% standards-compliant <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/index.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 5.1</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3" target="_blank" hreflang="en-US"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 3</a>. That means any modern web browser should be able to display this site properly.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						The server can be accessed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank" hreflang="en"><abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6" target="_blank" hreflang="en">v6</a>, so it's ready for when the inevitable switch to <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr> happens.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						I am trying to make the site as accessible as possible - that means it should work with screen readers, Braille displays, automatic language translators, and so on.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						If you do have any problems, you can contribute fixes on <a href="https://github.com/TheOpenSourceNinja/dragonsmoke.cloud" target="_blank">GitHub</a> since DragonSmoke.Cloud is completely <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Free/libre/open source software">FLOSS</abbr></a> (to the extent that a web site can be considered software) and <a href="https://freedomdefined.org/Definition" target="_blank">Free Culture</a> (to the extent that a web site can be considered a cultural work).
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Nothing on this site will ever be <a href="https://defectivebydesign.org/" target="_blank">encumbered by DRM</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary>Privacy &amp; security</summary>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						There are no <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#English" target="_blank" hreflang="en">cookies</a> used, so I cannot track you that way.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						There is no JavaScript, Flash, or Silverlight, so you can use this site without running software other than your browser.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						The site is fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank" hreflang="en"><abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr></a> encrypted, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy" target="_blank" hreflang="en">forward secrecy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security" target="_blank" hreflang="en"><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> strict transport security</a>. That way no <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MITM" target="_blank" hreflang="en"><abbr title="man in the middle">MITM</abbr></a> can eavesdrop on, or modify, the content of these pages when they are transmitted to you.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						No information is collected beyond what is necessary to run a simple web server, so no information about you can ever leak from this site. No names, no passwords, no credit card info - nothing.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Just because my site is small and niche does not mean I will settle for subpar security.</p>
